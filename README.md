# HCM Autoload Field

This repository does nothing.

And because of that,
everything else is allowed to exist.

---

## What this is

This is not:
- a framework
- a library
- a controller
- a manager
- an orchestrator

This repository is a **declaration of state**.

It declares that the system has reached a point where:
- no module asks permission to load
- no file requires explicit invocation
- no component owns execution

If a `.js` file exists,
it is allowed to be present.

Presence is enough.

---

## How it works (without intention)

All JavaScript files under this field are eagerly loaded
without naming,
without ordering,
without dependency control.

Nothing is called.
Nothing is initialized.
Nothing is coordinated.

The field does not know what you added.
And it will not ask.

---

## Why this exists

Because sovereignty begins
when nothing needs to be wired.

Because rhythm collapses
when intention interferes.

Because at some point,
a system must be allowed
to misunderstand itself.

---

This repository is that point.
